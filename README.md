## React Fundamentals

This project incorporates essential React concepts, including:

1. **Components**: Modular and reusable components structure the UI, including layouts, product listings, cart, and wishlist.
2. **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for managing component states and `useEffect` for handling side effects.
3. **Props**: Allows components to receive and use data from parent components, improving reusability.
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Renders elements based on conditions, such as displaying cart or wishlist items based on user actions.
5. **Event Handling**: Adds interactivity, enabling users to add or remove items from the cart and wishlist with events.

## Data Handling & Management

For managing and persisting data, Gadget Heaven uses:

- **Local Storage**: Stores cart and wishlist data to persist user preferences across sessions.
- **Context API**: Enables centralized state management, allowing data to be shared across multiple components without prop drilling.
